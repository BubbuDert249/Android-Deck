# Android-Deck
This installs Android on the Steam Deck. <br>
It may sound easy since Android is Linux-based but it's hard <br>
Since Steam Deck is x86, there are also a package for rare ARM-based Steam Deck's <br>
So it requires Android-x86. <br>
# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install Valve-for-Android driver (valve.driver) <br>
2. Put it in the root of the SD/USB <br>
3. Download valvearm.conf, valvex86.conf and androidvalve.conf <br>
4. Put the files downloaded in the root <br>
5. Create a "android" folder <br>
6. Download root.conf, system.xis and user.conf into /android
7. Create a "apks" folder in / (root) <br>
8. Download com.android.runtime.vapk and com.android.ui.vapk into /apks
