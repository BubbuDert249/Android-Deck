# Contributing to ChromeDeck

We welcome contributions to ChromeDeck! Please follow the guidelines below to help make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Create a New Branch
Create a branch for your work. This keeps your changes separate from the `main` branch, allowing for easier collaboration and review.
```git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name```

### 3. Make Your Changes
Make your changes or improvements in your branch. We recommend keeping each change isolated to a single task or feature for easier code review.

### 4. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes, make sure to test them thoroughly. Ensure that your changes don’t break existing functionality and follow the project’s code style.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you have made. The message should follow the convention:
```[Type of change] - A short description of the change```
For example:
```Fix - Corrected spelling mistake in README```

### 6. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:
```git push origin feature/your-feature-name```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of what your pull request does and why the changes are necessary.
